# ShoesHere Inventory Management System
## Background and Problem Statement
When small and medium sized enterprises begin their operations, they tend to use manual stock taking methods such as pen-paper stock taking. As the business grows, and the demand for products increases, the need for a new way of managing stock arises. 
Inefficiencies brought about by manual stock taking methods, such as mismanagement of stock by employees, result in heavy losses and may ultimately lead to closure of the business.

## Project Justification
After analyzing existing solutions like Deskera and Netsuite, it became conclusive that those systems are developed for fully-fledged companies with rigid operations.
That said, this project is important in the sense that it adapts to the processes that surround SMEs. It is minimalistic in the sense that every user performs only the most vital functions with regards to the business processes. Additionally, it can be easily integrated with existing point of sale applications that maybe the business already has in place.

## Feedback
- [ ] 1. Integrate the Point of Sale System, i.e, emulate/simulate buying and selling to reduce stock
- [ ] 2. Clarify User Roles: Admin, Manager, and Employee roles
- [ ] 3. An admin/business owner might not be involved in the day-to-day operations. So how can the process of ordering and requesting for stock be delegated, say to the manager, in such a way that there is maximum efficiency in terms of requesting for stock?
